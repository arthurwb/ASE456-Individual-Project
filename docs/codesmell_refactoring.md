## Code Smell: Large Method
* Found in the main scaffold structure in the main app. Refactored by moving textfield builder and elevated button builders to their own methods: Extract Metod

## Bloaters:
* Long Method: The build method in _TimeTrackerScreenState is quite long. Considering to breaking it down into smaller, more focused methods.

## Dispensables:
* Duplicate Code: The code for creating TextField widgets is repeated multiple times. I will consider creating a method to generate these fields to reduce duplication.

## Couplers:
* Feature Envy: The saveTimeEntry method has a dependency on the specific structure of the Firestore and uses controllers directly. I will consider refactoring to reduce coupling and improve testability.
